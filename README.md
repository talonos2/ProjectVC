# ProjectVC
A mobile-like game in which you build a town for metagame progression and see an auto-chess like battle as the combat system.

# Base Concept
I wanted to try my hand at one of those sity-building games like clash of clans, etc. I enjoy the metagame systems in those sorts of games and wanted to try to work on one on my own.

Of course, that meant I needed a base game upon which to build a metagame progression...

Project VC is currently just a combat simulator, where you have a lot of units fighting each other on a large map, 
like a grid based RTS, but just the part where balls of units attack each other. With the combat system mostly complete
(but only with generic units, special abilities are to be added later) I am now working on the metagame progression
in which you build a town, take over new square to expland your town by fighting battles, and progress through a tech
tree to improve your soldiers.

Below is a low quality gif that shows a battle in action:

I was writing this project  as I was working on job applications. I ran into an application that asked for a link to a github that had "production quality code,"
and I realized that because I mostly use Github to collaberate with my friends (who know how to program but have never been trained to write clean code) all the
stuff on my github looks nightmarish from a code architecture perspective. Thus, I uploaded this project to showcase what my code looks like when I write it
_on my own_. I put in way more comments than I usually do when coding recreationally, because that's what I'd do in a corporate environment. Besides that,
I haven't made much more of an attempt to clean up my code than I usually do. Consider this, as opposed to all of my other repos, to represent what I consider
to be "clean code".

I started this projet 6 days before committing to this repo for the first time.
